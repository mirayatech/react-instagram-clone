 <h2> Instagram clone based on Demon slayer characters </h2>  
</div>


### 💡 - About this project
You must sign in with google to be able to like and comment on the demon slayer post. The same applies to being able to upload a post with a caption. Other users can like and comment on your posts. Deleting your own posts and comments also works. You can also like other people's comments and follow the 
suggested users on the side profile as long as you are logged in.

**Note:** I designed the instagram logo with Nezuko (Nezuko = the character sitting in front of the instagram logo) <br><br>


### 🧠 - What I've learned 

- Using `useContext`
- useEffect with cleanup
- Type Narrowing in TypeScript
- Order Firestore data by TimeStamp
- Create private/authentication route
- Integrate Google Authentication with Firebase
- Using firestore and cloud storage at the same time (to be able to upload a post)
- And much more...
